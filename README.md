# CS2030S-Notes
My Notes for AY21/22 Sem 2

There are no notes made for Lecture 1 - 3;
I will be making my Lab solutions private due to privacy concerns.

After completing the module, students should:

   - be confident in reading and developing medium-scale programs (up to 10K lines of code)
   - be familiarize enough with common OO concepts to understand software code written in common OO language and understand documentation of software libraries in OO
   - be able to apply OO concepts to design and implement medium to large scale programs, including
       - design and implement a class
       - decompose a problem solution into classes and define members and methods for each class
       - use polymorphism effectively
       - use inheritance to design simple class hierarchies that allow code reuse
       - trace the control flow of a programs that use dynamic dispatch
       - use encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces, private methods/members
   - be familiarize enough with common functional programming concepts and constructs, including lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, infinite streams.
   - be able to apply functional programming concepts to design and implement , including:
       - Implement basic algorithms in functions that are effect free.
       - Implement useful functions that take/return another function
       - Write correct and effective code using lambda expressions and/or infinite streams
   - be able to compare and contrast imperative programming, OO programming, and function programming paradigms, and select the most natural paradigms for each situation
   - be aware of how the OOP and FP concepts are implemented in different ways in different programming languages
   - be confident enough to learn new programming languages that uses OOP and FP paradigm
   - attain proficiency in Java 8 (and above)
   - be equipped with solid programming foundations for further studies in computer science
